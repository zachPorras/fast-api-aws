# fast-api-aws

This project is a basic skeleton for a scalable API deployed using API Gateway, Lambda, & S3 services on AWS. 

The app is written using the FASTApi framework & Python 3.8

<br>

I intend on utilzing this as a reference for future APIs custom-fitted to any application.

Currently, the working endpoints for this API are as follow:

- https://4u3yepaxt5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/
- https://4u3yepaxt5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/api/v1/users/

### Hope you enjoy!
